Comecei a ler o _The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages_, do Harold Bloom, e um trecho me chamou atenção.

> I have tried to confront greatness directly: to ask what makes the author and the works
canonical. The answer, more often than not, has turned out to be strangeness, a mode of originality that either cannot be assimilated, or that so assimilates us that we cease to see it as strange. Walter Pater defined Romanticism as adding strangeness to beauty, but I think he characterized all canonical writing rather than the Romantics as such. The cycle of achievement goes from _The Divine Comedy_ to _Endgame_, from strangeness to strangeness. When you read a canonical work for a first time you encounter a stranger, an uncanny startlement rather than a fulfillment of expectations. Read freshly, all that _The Divine Comedy_, _Paradise Lost_, _Faust Part Two_, _Hadji Murad_, _Peer Gynt_, _Ulysses_, and _Canto general_ have in common is their uncanniness, their ability to make you feel strange at home.

Há uma diferença de magnitude entre obras de arte que sempre me pareceu estar ligada ao quanto a grande arte é capaz de nos causar estranheza, de nos mudar de alguma forma, internamente, por algum tempo. O sublime não é apenas belo, mas estranho e aterrorizante.

Burke também diz algo semelhante:

> Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain, and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the sublime; that is, it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling ... When danger or pain press too nearly, they are incapable of giving any delight, and [yet] with certain modifications, they may be, and they are delightful, as we every day experience.

E Kant,

> Whereas the beautiful is limited, the sublime is limitless, so that the mind in the presence of the sublime, attempting to imagine what it cannot, has pain in the failure but pleasure in contemplating the immensity of the attempt.
